hypothetical question:
What code do we need to change/add/remove to support this feature?

We will have to add the following steps:
1) A text view with button in the xml file
2) A logic functional implementation in SimpleCalculatorImpl,java file
3) A GUI implementation in Main activity file
4) Tests - unit tests, app flow, and GUI tests

Which tests can we run on the calculator? On the activity? On the app?
We can run on the calculator - unit tests for testing functionality of logic operators and operands.
we also can run on the activity of the calculator GUI tests which check the match between front clicks
to backend logic implementation. also we can test the support of Vertical and horizontal view.
On the app we can check the SDK and versions of the android which are supported by the app, also we can check
the swiping between activities.
